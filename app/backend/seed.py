"""Seed the database with demo data.

Usage:
    .venv/bin/python seed.py              # seed if tables empty
    .venv/bin/python seed.py --reset      # wipe and reseed

Media URLs point to real, publicly reachable files (verified with curl before
being added here) instead of placeholder links, so every media type
(image/audio/video/text) actually renders in the frontend:
  - images: picsum.photos (real photos, deterministic per seed)
  - audio:  soundhelix.com sample tracks
  - video:  MDN's CC0 sample clips (interactive-examples.mdn.mozilla.net)
  - text:   inline caption only (no url) so it always renders, no fetch needed
