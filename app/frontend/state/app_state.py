"""Reactive application state.

AppState is a dataclass decorated with flet's ``@observable`` so that any
attribute assignment notifies subscribed components, which re-render. Screens
receive the shared instance as a component argument; mutations (e.g.
``state.current_index += 1``) drive the UI automatically.
